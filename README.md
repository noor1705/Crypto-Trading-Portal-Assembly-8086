# Crypto Trading Portal

## Overview
The Crypto Trading Portal is a console-based application developed in Assembly language, designed to simulate a Binance-like environment for buying, selling, and displaying cryptocurrency. This program enables users to manage cryptocurrency transactions in a secure and user-friendly interface.

Unlike traditional trading platforms, this portal does not require user accounts or registrations. Instead, it functions as an agency where users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies and track their balance accordingly.

## Features
- *Buy Cryptocurrency*: Users can purchase cryptocurrencies using their available balance.
- *Sell Cryptocurrency*: Users can sell their holdings and receive funds in return.
- *Real-Time Balance Updates*: The wallet balance is updated dynamically after each transaction.
- *Simple Console-Based Interface*: Provides an interactive and minimalistic environment for trading.
- *Assembly Language Implementation*: Offers hands-on experience with low-level programming and system architecture.

## How It Works
1. The user starts with an initial balance.
2. They can choose to buy or sell cryptocurrencies based on available funds.
3. The system calculates transactions and updates the balance accordingly.
4. The program provides real-time feedback on transactions and wallet status.

## Requirements
- An assembler and emulator supporting Assembly language.
- A system capable of running Assembly code (e.g., DOSBox for x86 Assembly).
